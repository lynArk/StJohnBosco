### My very first webpages, dedicated to a Catholic Saint, for the bit.

When I was in high school, I took an "Intro to Computer Science" class. I was captivated by everything related to computers. At the time, I "didn't know what I didn't know", as they say. I had little knowledge about the industry, and had no technical skills to speak of. But still, I did someday see myself making a living off of that budding interest of mine. So, "Intro to Computer Science" was an easy and intriguing choice.

The coursework was very streamlined. To start, we learned basic HTML and CSS, and used that knowledge to write a few webpages. We had the complete creative freedom to choose what the topic of our webpages would be. Trying to think of a topic, my mind landed on a running joke I had with my friends. I had gone down a rabbit hole, trying to discover the origins of the popular American school lunch item, "Bosco Sticks". As it turns out, they were named after a small Michigan pizzeria. In turn, that pizzeria was named after the late Catholic Saint, John Bosco. Our jokes involved talk of making T-shirts and distributing Bosco Sticks for his "feast day," a holiday in the Catholic Church. None of us were Catholic, yet the joke wasnâ€™t about mocking religious traditions. Rather, the joke was in focusing on something so niche. I even grew to respect the man. And so I had my topic.

I quite enjoyed researching Bosco and creating a little "website" about him. Unfortunately, all development was halted right around when COVID-19 hit the world. I still vividly remember my teacher talking to us early on, about how it would not be long before the virus made its way into our home state. As this came to fruition, a series of unfortunate events took place in my life. Some related to the pandemic, some not. I stopped partaking in the coursework altogether, never grasping the next section: JavaScript. My website never became more than the most basic of html pages. Thankfully, my teacher was very kind and empathetic towards the toll the pandemic was taking on us students. He didn't fail me out of the class, despite how I deserved it.

Years have passed and I never had it in me to pick up where I left off. For so long, I was caught up in self-pity. Everything was "keeping me away" from pursuing my interests. It wasn't until recently, that I realized the only real obstacle was myself. I don't need to fear being too far behind to start, or that I'm simply not capable. The truth is that I can learn whatever I want, whenever I want. And while I don't necessarily want to build websites, I know now that my interest lies specifically in system administration and cloud computing. I can do those things, so I will.

Previously I would avoid thinking about that Intro class, because it brought back painful memories of failure. In uploading these webpages, I am framing a permanent reminder of my past failure. I do not want to ignore it any longer. I want to acknowledge where I've fallen short, and let that encourage me to move forward.
